# Personalized Anime Recommendations with Power BI

## Overview

This project explores the application of data visualization and reporting techniques in the creation of personalized anime recommendations. Utilizing the "Top Anime 2020" dataset from Kaggle, we have developed a Power BI dashboard that analyzes various factors such as anime titles, studios, producers, and ratings to enhance the recommendation process.

## Project Aim

The primary aim of this project is to leverage Microsoft Power BI tools to enhance the accuracy of anime recommendations by analyzing detailed attributes like genres, duration, and viewer ratings. This allows users to discover anime that aligns more closely with their preferences, beyond the traditional rating systems.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Users can interact with the visualization to filter and find anime based on personalized criteria such as genre, duration, and more.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Applies sophisticated data processing techniques to reveal patterns, correlations, and insights into anime watching habits.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be accessible and easy to navigate, enhancing the user experience in exploring anime options.

## Data

The data for this project is sourced from the [Anime Recommendation Database 2020 on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020?resource=download). It includes extensive details on user ratings, popularity, studio production, and more, across thousands of anime titles.
